# OTP Generator
```
This project is a simple OTP (One-Time Password) generator that creates secure passwords using random integer numbers. It can be used for various applications where temporary passwords are required, such as two-factor authentication (2FA) or temporary access codes.
```
## Features
```
- Generates secure OTPs of a specified length.
- Uses random integers to ensure unpredictability.
- Simple and easy to use.
- Can be easily integrated into existing projects.
```
## Installation
```
To use the OTP generator, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can download Node.js from the official website: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShuvaGuchhait/otp-generator-js.git
cd otp-generator-js
```

## Usage
```
You can use the OTP generator by running the `otpGenerator.js` script. Below is an example of how to generate an OTP:

```javascript
const otpGenerator = require('./otpGenerator');

// Generate a 6-digit OTP
const otp = otpGenerator.generateOtp(6);
console.log(`Your OTP is: ${otp}`);
```

### otpGenerator.js

Here's a sample implementation of the `otpGenerator.js` script:

```javascript
function generateOtp(length) {
    let otp = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        otp += Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
    }
    return otp;
}

module.exports = {
    generateOtp
};
```

## Examples
```
Here are a few examples of how you can use the OTP generator:
```
### Generate a 4-digit OTP

```javascript
const otp = otpGenerator.generateOtp(4);
console.log(`Your 4-digit OTP is: ${otp}`);
```

### Generate an 8-digit OTP

```javascript
const otp = otpGenerator.generateOtp(8);
console.log(`Your 8-digit OTP is: ${otp}`);
```
